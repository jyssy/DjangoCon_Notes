[Django's GeneratedField by example](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-s-generatedfield-by-example/)

- [www.paulox.net](https://www.paulox.net/)
- ref: [RandomUUID](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/postgres/functions/)
- [GeneratedField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/fields/#generatedfield)

```There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a regular column. A virtual generated column occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a materialized view.```

- [GeoJSON for structuring geographic data](https://geojson.org/)
