### [Easy, Breezy, Beautiful... Django Unit Tests](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/easy-breezy-beautiful-django-unit-tests/)

- unit testing
- units as source code
- unit tests compared to integration testing (which tests the whole thing)
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/testing/overview/
- RequestFactiory() for Unit testing (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/testing/advanced/)

[Django's GeneratedField by example](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-s-generatedfield-by-example/)

- [www.paulox.net](https://www.paulox.net/)
- ref: [RandomUUID](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/postgres/functions/)
- [GeneratedField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/fields/#generatedfield)

```There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a regular column. A virtual generated column occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a materialized view.```

### [Deploy Django: GitOps & Kubernetes Made Easy](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/deploy-djang-gitops-kubernetes-made-easy/)


'''You’ll learn how to:
Set up a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline that works across all environments
Automate rollouts, rollbacks, and version control of infrastructure
Understand why Kubernetes is a future-proof platform for Django teams
Gain confidence in releasing updates safely, consistently, and at scale
Leverage open source tools to eliminate manual deployment headaches
Whether you're writing the code or leading the team, you'll leave with a clear, practical blueprint for shipping faster — and with fewer surprises.'''

- sixfeetup/2025_
- ROllback values are the result
- ENV Drift Prevention
- Security (No CI/CD needs cluster credentiuals)
- Compliance 
- Why Kubernetes for Django?
--------------------------
- Resource effiencxy
- zero downtime deployments
- self-healing
- service discovery_ no more hardcoded URLs
- Secrets management
- Control plane (automate releases)
- Deploy story: matches developer env
-  Cloud agnostic: no vendor lockin

### [Keynote: All The Ways To Use Django](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-tuesday/)

- Best use of model forms
- native timezone support
- native authentication
--
- Django and Frontend frameworks
- has a native ORM and migration framework
- can create APIs and validation from the schema
- native auth and session management
-- looking at next.js
- has native backend react rendering
- can do server side rendering
- can have shared frontend-backend...
-- Django can embed JS frontends
```prop=var```
- Django augmengted with VUE
- should give front end dynamism on top of what django is already doing
```% load crispy_forms_tags %}```
-- Django is not just for monnoliths
- service that is co deployed from tis own repository
- ```realy need to look at django testing more```
-- Django and worker environments
- asymn tacts
- scheduled tasks withj celery or cron
- inter-databasd migration tool
- django has an awesome orm and migration framework
- background tasks can sare code and a database
- django settimghs allow swapping out the few things that are different for wokrer or speciality envs
- django's ORM is pluggable
- mssql-django/redshift/snowflake/mongodb
- consider django storage (path and metadata about storage even if it is stored someplace like in S3)
-- inheriting an ecosystem
- see the django_tools.jpeg file
-- Advice to Django contributors
- Djangvo needs a JS strategy
- people want to make JSON APIs in Django
1. have django forsm do serialization/deserialization
2. have django absorb django-rest-framework
3. jhave django officially endorse djan go-rest-framework as a solution
- people want JS frontends
- usde `collectstatic` and use template tags to embed react/vue/angular components
- Django needs to know where the static files are so they can be easily loaded and managed
- need intentional JS support builtin

### [High Performance Django at Ten: Old Tricks & New Picks](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/high-performance-django-at-ten-old-tricks-new-picks/)

`Peter Baumgartner - Peter is the founder of Lincoln Loop, having built it up from a small freelance operation in 2007 into a leading agency known for solving complex technical challenges with Django and Python. He is constantly learning and is well-versed in many technical disciplines including devops, scaling, back-end, and front-end development. Peter is a frequent speaker at DjangoCon and has given talks at PyCon and SaltConf as well. In 2013 he co-authored the book High Performance Django, detailing the techniques used at Lincoln Loop to build high-traffic, scalable sites with Django. He has been interviewed about Lincoln Loop's remote work style by Wired and 37signals and been published on Forbes, FastCompany and TechRepublic among others. Currently residing in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Peter enjoys a well balanced life with his wife and two children.

- `Database Optimization 0 In almost every dynamic web application, the database is the performance bottleneck. It frequently needs to access information from the disks (the slowest part of a modern computer) and performs expensive in-memory calculation for complex queries. Minimizing both the number of queries and the time they need to run is a sure-fire way to speed up your application. We can attack this problem from a number of different angles, and there are usually a lot of low-hanging fruit for easy optimization. The following recommendations are presented from easiest to most difficult. You can work your way down the list until you reach your desired efficiency.`
