### [Easy, Breezy, Beautiful... Django Unit Tests](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/easy-breezy-beautiful-django-unit-tests/)

[Django's GeneratedField by example](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-s-generatedfield-by-example/)

- [www.paulox.net](https://www.paulox.net/)
- ref: [RandomUUID](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/postgres/functions/)
- [GeneratedField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/fields/#generatedfield)

```There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a regular column. A virtual generated column occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a materialized view.```

### [Deploy Django: GitOps & Kubernetes Made Easy](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/deploy-djang-gitops-kubernetes-made-easy/)


'''You’ll learn how to:
Set up a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline that works across all environments
Automate rollouts, rollbacks, and version control of infrastructure
Understand why Kubernetes is a future-proof platform for Django teams
Gain confidence in releasing updates safely, consistently, and at scale
Leverage open source tools to eliminate manual deployment headaches
Whether you're writing the code or leading the team, you'll leave with a clear, practical blueprint for shipping faster — and with fewer surprises.'''
